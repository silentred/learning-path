Q: How do I put an already running process under nohup?
A: Using the Job Control of bash to send the process into the background:
1. Ctrl+Z 
to stop (pause) the program and get back to the shell.
2. bg 
to run it in the background.
3. disown -h [job-spec] 
where [job-spec] is the job number (like %1 for the first running job; find about your number with the jobs command) so that the job isn't killed when the terminal closes.
